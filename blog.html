                  <strong>var :</strong> The scope of a var variable is functional scope.Scope basically refers to the area in which these variables can be used. Var declarations can be function/locally or globally scoped.
                  When a var variable is declared outside of a function, the scope is global. This means that any variable declared outside of a function block using the var keyword is accessible throughout the entire window.
                  When a variable is declared inside a function, it has function scope. This indicates that it is accessible and limited to that function.

                    <strong>let :</strong>A block is a section of code that is bounded by. Curly braces house a block. A block is anything contained in curly brackets.
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-body">
                    <strong>const</strong>Constant values are kept for variables specified using the const keyword. Let declarations and const declarations have some similarities.
                    The scope of const declarations is blocked.
                    Const declarations, like let declarations are only accessible within the block in which they were made.
                    It is impossible to modify or re-declare const.

                  <strong>null :</strong> null is a special value that represents the absence of an object. It is often used to indicate that a variable does not have a value or that an object does not exist. 
                  Null is not the same as an empty string or a zero value, as those values are still considered to have a value. Instead, null represents the absence of a value or object.

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <strong>undefined :</strong>undefined is a special value that is assigned to a variable by default when the variable is declared but no value is explicitly assigned to it. 
                  It is often used to check if a variable has been assigned a value or not.

                  <strong>REST API :</strong> There are numerous types of APIs, 
                  making it difficult for new developers to differentiate between each kind. In particular, Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that developers apply to web APIs. 
                  REST APIs provide simple, uniform interfaces because they can be used to make data, content, algorithms, media, and other digital resources available through web URLs. Essentially, 
                  REST APIs are the most common APIs used across the web today.
